== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn't CAPTCHA showing in both WooCommerce login and registration form? =

Multiple instance of reCAPTCHA can not appear in the same page i.e only a single reCAPTCHA can exist per web page. That's how reCAPTCHA was programmed.

If you activate the CAPTCHA in both login and registration form, in WooCommerce checkout and My Account page, the CAPTCHA will appear only
in the login form.
